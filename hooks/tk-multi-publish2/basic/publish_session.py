        Publishes the file to Flow Production Tracking. A <b>Publish</b>
        entry will be created in Flow Production Tracking which will
        include a reference to the file's current path on disk. If a
        publish template is configured, a copy of the current session
        will be copied to the publish template path which will be the
        file that is published. Other users will be able to access the
        published file via the <b><a href='%s'>Loader</a></b> so long as
        they have access to the file's location on disk.

        If the session has not been saved, validation will fail and a button
        will be provided in the logging output to save the file.

        <h3>File versioning</h3>
        If the filename contains a version number, the process will bump the
        file to the next version after publishing.

        The <code>version</code> field of the resulting <b>Publish</b> in
        Flow Production Tracking will also reflect the version number identified
        in the filename. The basic worklfow recognizes the following version
        formats by default:

        <ul>
        <li><code>filename.v###.ext</code></li>
        <li><code>filename_v###.ext</code></li>
        <li><code>filename-v###.ext</code></li>
        </ul>

        After publishing, if a version number is detected in the work file, the
        work file will automatically be saved to the next incremental version
        number. For example, <code>filename.v001.ext</code> will be published
        and copied to <code>filename.v002.ext</code>

        If the next incremental version of the file already exists on disk, the
        validation step will produce a warning, and a button will be provided in
        the logging output which will allow saving the session to the next
        available version number prior to publishing.

        <br><br><i>NOTE: any amount of version number padding is supported. for
        non-template based workflows.</i>

        <h3>Overwriting an existing publish</h3>
        In non-template workflows, a file can be published multiple times,
        however only the most recent publish will be available to other users.
        Warnings will be provided during validation if there are previous
        publishes.

        This method is required to be defined in order for the custom UI to show up in the app.

        Allows the custom UI to populate its fields with the settings from the
        currently selected tasks.

        The widget is the widget created and returned by
        `create_settings_widget`.

        A list of settings dictionaries are supplied representing the current
        values of the settings for selected tasks. The settings dictionaries
        correspond to the dictionaries returned by the settings property of the
        hook.

        Example::

            settings = [
            {
                 "seeting_a": "/path/to/a/file"
                 "setting_b": False
            },

                 "setting_a": "/path/to/a/file"
                 "setting_b": False
            }]

        The default values for the settings will be the ones specified in the
        environment file. Each task has its own copy of the settings.

        When invoked with multiple settings dictionaries, it is the
        responsibility of the custom UI to decide how to display the
        information. If you do not wish to implement the editing of multiple
        tasks at the same time, you can raise a ``NotImplementedError`` when
        there is more than one item in the list and the publisher will inform
        the user than only one task of that type can be edited at a time.

        :param widget: The widget that was created by `create_settings_widget`.
        :param settings: a list of dictionaries of settings for each selected
            task.
        :param items: A list of PublishItems the selected publish tasks are parented to.
