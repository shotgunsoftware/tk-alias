New Features

**Background Publishing Setting**

A new publish setting option has been added to the Publish2 App to turn on/off publishing in the background. This requires tk-multi-publish2 ``v2.10.3`` or later.

To use the new publish setting:

1. Open the Publish2 App
2. Click on the root publish item *Current Alias Session*
3. Check the Settings option *Perform publish in the background* to run the publish in the background (or uncheck to run normally)

.. note::

    This new setting in the Publish App has replaced the ``Background Processing`` configuration setting. This setting does not need to be added to perform background publishing, the setting in the Publish2 App will handle this. You may still set the configuration setting to set the default value of the checkbox option in the Publish App.
