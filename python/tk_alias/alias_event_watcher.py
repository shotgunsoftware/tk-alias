class AliasEventWatcher(object):
    """
    An object to manage Alias message events and callbacks.

    This class provides methods to register and unregister Alias message event callbacks.
    The events and their callbacks are stored in the class object so that they can be
    managed, including removing the callbacks on application shutdown.

    An Alias message event can be registered, which adds the message handler using the
    Alias Python API. The callbacks associated with the events will be triggered when
    this object is `watching` for Alias message events.

    Similarly, an Alias message event can be unregistered, meaning that the Python callback
    will no longer be triggered for the Alias message event.

        ensures that any Python callbacks triggered by Alias message events are queued
        (not executed immediately), and will be executed once the exit method is called.
